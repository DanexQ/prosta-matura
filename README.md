Hi! I want you to present my first big project called Prosta Matura. This app was created for polish students studying for their advanced math matura exam. Throughout my career as a this year's high school graduate I couldn't find any type of website having all of the tasks of this exam in one place, so I did it. Everyone can use this app for free just sign in with google account. Prosta Matura is made with NextJS, React, NextAuth, Tailwind, Prisma and PlanetScale as database. I'm very proud of it, because I've had a lot of fun doing this project and it has brought me new valuable experience. Don't wait, check my app and it's code, because any feedback is very welcome. I would be grateful for any code review.
